    "text": "My father Fred Hoiberg is the head men’s basketball coach at the University of Nebraska. He is going into his 5th year coaching, and after a very solid last season, things are looking up. He is also one of several other college basketball coaches that played in the NBA. He was a star college basketball player at Iowa State University where he averaged over 20 points per game his last two seasons. After graduating, he was drafted to the Indiana Pacers where he played for a few years as a role player. Then he went to the Chicago Bulls to be a main part of a rebuilding team just after Michael Jordan left the team. After playing in Chicago for a few years, he played the final part of career for the Minnesota Timberwolves with an MVP-level Kevin Garnett where they made the Western conference finals before losing to Kobe and Shaq. He finally retired after 10 years in the league due to a heart issue, but I have always wondered how good of a player he was since I could not watch him much. So, I decided to look at how his NBA numbers compare to the other college coaches today including the likes Anfernee “Penny” Hardaway, Jerry Stackhouse, Juwan Howard, and others.\nMy dad was known for being a spot up shooter who you could depend on to hit a three when you needed it. He was not a huge scorer as he was mainly a role player during his career playing next to some of the great scorers of all time such as Kevin Garnett and Reggie Miller. I compliled a list of college basketball coaches that played in the NBA and looked at how they measured up to the rest of the league in shooting and scoring. The scoring was based on the amount of points they scored and averaged, as well as how efficient they were in doing so. The shooting measurement was based on three point makes as well as three point and free throw percentages. If the number is in the negatives, it means they were below average, if they were aboveThe chart turned out to be pretty much what I expected in regards to my dad as he was a below average scorer, but well above average shooter. Juwan Howard was the best scorer of the bunch, while Mo Williams was the best shooter.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(cowplot)\n\nplayers <- read_csv(\"Nba.csv\")\n\nplayers <- players %>%\n  mutate(\n    PPG = PTS/G\n  )\n\nplayerz <- players %>%\n  filter(PTS > 0) %>%\n  group_by(Season) %>%\n  mutate(\n    PTSzscore = as.numeric(scale(PTS, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),\n    PPGzscore = as.numeric(scale(PPG, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),\n    FGPCTzscore = as.numeric(scale(`FG%`, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),\n    FGMzscore = as.numeric(scale(FG, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),\n    FGAzscore = as.numeric(scale(FGA, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),\n    TotalZscore = PTSzscore + PPGzscore + FGPCTzscore + FGMzscore + FGAzscore\n  ) %>% ungroup()\n\ncoaches <- playerz %>%\n  filter(Player == \"Fred Hoiberg\" |\n         Player == \"Juwan Howard\" |\n         Player == \"Bobby Hurley\" |\n         Player == \"Mike Woodson\" |\n         Player == \"Johnny Dawkins\" |\n         Player == \"Anfernee Hardaway\" |\n         Player == \"Jerry Stackhouse\" |\n         Player == \"Hubert Davis\" |\n         Player == \"Damon Stoudamire\" |\n         Player == \"Mo Williams\" |\n         Player == \"Tony Bennett\" |\n         Player == \"Bryce Drew\")\n  \n\nFredscore <- coaches %>% filter(Player == \"Fred Hoiberg\")\n\nplayerzshooting <- players %>%\n  filter(PTS >0, `3P`>0) %>%\n  group_by(Season) %>%\n  mutate(\n    `3Pzscore` = as.numeric(scale(`3P`, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),\n    `3PPCTzscore` = as.numeric(scale(`3P%`, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),\n    `FT%zscore` = as.numeric(scale(`FT%`, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),\n    ShootTotalzscore = `3Pzscore` + `3PPCTzscore` + `FT%zscore`\n  ) %>% ungroup()\n\ncoachesshooting <- playerzshooting %>%\n  filter(Player == \"Fred Hoiberg\" |\n         Player == \"Juwan Howard\" |\n         Player == \"Bobby Hurley\" |\n         Player == \"Mike Woodson\" |\n         Player == \"Johnny Dawkins\" |\n         Player == \"Anfernee Hardaway\" |\n         Player == \"Jerry Stackhouse\" |\n         Player == \"Hubert Davis\" |\n         Player == \"Damon Stoudamire\" |\n         Player == \"Mo Williams\" |\n         Player == \"Tony Bennett\" |\n         Player == \"Bryce Drew\")\n\nFredshoot <- coachesshooting %>% filter(Player == \"Fred Hoiberg\")\n\nPlayersPureShoot <- players %>%\n  filter(\n    Season>1980 & `3PA`>50 & FTA>30\n  )\n\ncoachespureshoot <- coaches%>%\n  filter(\n    Season>1980 & `3PA`>50 & FTA>30)\n\nFredpureshoot <- coachespureshoot %>% filter(Player == \"Fred Hoiberg\")\n\nbar1 <- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=coaches, aes(x=reorder(Player, TotalZscore), weight=TotalZscore), fill=\"grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=Fredscore, aes(x=reorder(Player, TotalZscore), weight=TotalZscore), fill= \"#E41C38\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title=\"NCAA basketball coaches that played in the NBA: shooting and scoring ability\", subtitle= \"Fred Hoiberg was a below average scorer, but very efficient shooter.\", y=\"Scoring compared to rest of NBA\", x= \"\", caption = \"\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 9), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\nbar2 <- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=coachesshooting, aes(x=reorder(Player, ShootTotalzscore), weight=ShootTotalzscore), fill=\"grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=Fredshoot, aes(x=reorder(Player, ShootTotalzscore), weight=ShootTotalzscore), fill=\"#E41C38\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title=\"\", subtitle= \"\", x=\"\", y=\"Shooting compared to rest of NBA\", caption=\"Source: Basketball Reference| By Sam Hoiberg\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 9), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=11), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\nplot_grid(bar1, bar2)\n\n\n\n\n\nSince my dad was known as a knockdown shooter, I wanted to look at how his three point and free throw percentages compared to the rest of the coaches, as well as every player that has played since the 1980 season, which was the oldest coach of the list Mike Woodson’s rookie season. I had a feeling that he would place well in this list because he led the league in three point shooting during his last season playing at 48.3 percent. I made a scatter plot with every player since 1980, showcasing the other coaches in dark grey points, as well as pointing out my dad’s season’s in red dots. He had a few streaky seasons shooting the three but for the most part was consistently a great three point shooter. He also almost always shot above 80% from the free throw line. He had the best pure shooting season of the coaches which was also one of the best pure shooting seasons of all time!\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=PlayersPureShoot, aes(x=`3P%`, y=`FT%`), color=\"light grey\") +\n  geom_point(data=coachespureshoot, aes(x=`3P%`, y=`FT%`), color=\"dark grey\") + \n  geom_point(data=Fredpureshoot, aes(x=`3P%`, y=`FT%`), color=\"#E41C38\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=Fredpureshoot, aes(x=`3P%`, y=`FT%`, label= Player)) +\n  labs(title=\"NCAA basketball coaches that played in the NBA: Pure shooting ability\", subtitle=\"Fred was very consistent at the line as well as behind the arc near every season. In fact, he had one of the best \\npure shooting seasons since 1980.\", y= \"Free Throw Percentage\", x=\"Three Point Percentage\", caption = \"Source: Basketball Reference | By Sam Hoiberg\") +\n    theme_minimal() +\n    theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 9), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final category I wanted to compare these coaches was in passing ability as well as their ability to take care of the ball. My dad was a role player and a shooting guard so naturally, I did not expect him to be on the high end in assist numbers, but I had no idea what to expect in regards to taking care of the basketball. I made a dumbbell chart showcasing how each of the coaches shaped up against the rest of the league . I used a statistical measure of distance called a zscore and added them up to see their assist and turnover numbers compared the league average. The farther right the green dot is, the better the player was at passing, while the farther left the red dot was, the better they were at taking care of the ball. I found that Damon Stoudamire was the best passer of the group, and Jerry Stackhouse was the worst at taking care of the basketball. My dad was on the low end of assist numbers, but he was the best at not turning the ball over.\n\n\nCode\nplayers <- players %>%\n  mutate(\n    APG = AST/G,\n    TOPG = TOV/G\n  )\n\nplayerzpassing <- players %>%\n  filter(AST > 0) %>%\n  group_by(Season) %>%\n  mutate(\n    ASTzscore = as.numeric(scale(AST, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),\n    APGzscore = as.numeric(scale(APG, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),\n    TOVzscore = as.numeric(scale(TOV, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),\n    TOPGzscore = as.numeric(scale(TOPG, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),\n    PassTotalzscore = ASTzscore + APGzscore + TOVzscore + TOPGzscore\n  ) %>% ungroup()\n\ncoachespassing <- playerzpassing %>%\n  filter(Player == \"Fred Hoiberg\" |\n         Player == \"Juwan Howard\" |\n         Player == \"Bobby Hurley\" |\n         Player == \"Mike Woodson\" |\n         Player == \"Johnny Dawkins\" |\n         Player == \"Anfernee Hardaway\" |\n         Player == \"Jerry Stackhouse\" |\n         Player == \"Hubert Davis\" |\n         Player == \"Damon Stoudamire\" |\n         Player == \"Mo Williams\" |\n         Player == \"Tony Bennett\" |\n         Player == \"Bryce Drew\")\n\nasttov <- coachespassing %>% group_by(Player) %>% summarize(TotalTOVZ = sum(TOVzscore), totalASTZ = sum(ASTzscore))\n\nFredpass <- asttov %>% filter(Player == \"Fred Hoiberg\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=asttov,\n    aes(y=reorder(Player, totalASTZ), x=TotalTOVZ, xend=totalASTZ),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"#E41C38\",\n    colour_xend = \"#549C30\"\n  ) + labs(title= \"NCAA basketball coaches that played in the NBA: Assists compared to turnovers\", subtitle = \"Fred Hoiberg was below average in <span style = 'color:#549C30;'>assists</span>, but at least he did not <span style = 'color:#E41C38;'>give the ball away</span>.\", y= \"\", x=\"Assists and Turnovers compared to the rest of the NBA\", caption = \"Source: Basketball Reference| By Sam Hoiberg\") +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )"
