    "text": "My father Fred Hoiberg is the head men’s basketball coach at the University of Nebraska. He is going into his 5th year coaching, and after a very solid last season, things are looking up. He is also one of several other college basketball coaches that played in the NBA. He was a star college basketball player at Iowa State University where he averaged over 20 points per game his last two seasons. After graduating, he was drafted to the Indiana Pacers where he played for a few years as a role player. Then he went to the Chicago Bulls to be a main part of a rebuilding team just after Michael Jordan left the team. After playing in Chicago for a few years, he played the final part of career for the Minnesota Timberwolves with an MVP-level Kevin Garnett where they made the Western conference finals before losing to Kobe and Shaq. He finally retired after 10 years in the league due to a heart issue, but I have always wondered how good of a player he actually was since I could not watch him much. So, I decided to look at how his NBA numbers compare to the other college coaches today such as Anfernee “Penny” Hardaway, Jerry Stackhouse, Juwan Howard, and others.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(cowplot)\n\nplayers <- read_csv(\"Nba.csv\")\n\nplayers <- players %>%\n  mutate(\n    PPG = PTS/G\n  )\n\nplayerz <- players %>%\n  filter(PTS > 0) %>%\n  group_by(Season) %>%\n  mutate(\n    PTSzscore = as.numeric(scale(PTS, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),\n    PPGzscore = as.numeric(scale(PPG, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),\n    FGPCTzscore = as.numeric(scale(`FG%`, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),\n    FGMzscore = as.numeric(scale(FG, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),\n    FGAzscore = as.numeric(scale(FGA, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),\n    TotalZscore = PTSzscore + PPGzscore + FGPCTzscore + FGMzscore + FGAzscore\n  ) %>% ungroup()\n\ncoaches <- playerz %>%\n  filter(Player == \"Fred Hoiberg\" |\n         Player == \"Juwan Howard\" |\n         Player == \"Bobby Hurley\" |\n         Player == \"Mike Woodson\" |\n         Player == \"Johnny Dawkins\" |\n         Player == \"Anfernee Hardaway\" |\n         Player == \"Jerry Stackhouse\" |\n         Player == \"Hubert Davis\" |\n         Player == \"Damon Stoudamire\" |\n         Player == \"Mo Williams\" |\n         Player == \"Tony Bennett\" |\n         Player == \"Bryce Drew\")\n  \n\nFredscore <- coaches %>% filter(Player == \"Fred Hoiberg\")\n\nplayerzshooting <- players %>%\n  filter(PTS >0, `3P`>0) %>%\n  group_by(Season) %>%\n  mutate(\n    `3Pzscore` = as.numeric(scale(`3P`, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),\n    `3PPCTzscore` = as.numeric(scale(`3P%`, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),\n    `FT%zscore` = as.numeric(scale(`FT%`, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),\n    ShootTotalzscore = `3Pzscore` + `3PPCTzscore` + `FT%zscore`\n  ) %>% ungroup()\n\ncoachesshooting <- playerzshooting %>%\n  filter(Player == \"Fred Hoiberg\" |\n         Player == \"Juwan Howard\" |\n         Player == \"Bobby Hurley\" |\n         Player == \"Mike Woodson\" |\n         Player == \"Johnny Dawkins\" |\n         Player == \"Anfernee Hardaway\" |\n         Player == \"Jerry Stackhouse\" |\n         Player == \"Hubert Davis\" |\n         Player == \"Damon Stoudamire\" |\n         Player == \"Mo Williams\" |\n         Player == \"Tony Bennett\" |\n         Player == \"Bryce Drew\")\n\nFredshoot <- coachesshooting %>% filter(Player == \"Fred Hoiberg\")\n\nPlayersPureShoot <- players %>%\n  filter(\n    Season>1980 & `3PA`>50 & FTA>30\n  )\n\ncoachespureshoot <- coaches%>%\n  filter(\n    Season>1980 & `3PA`>50 & FTA>30)\n\nFredpureshoot <- coachespureshoot %>% filter(Player == \"Fred Hoiberg\")\n\nbar1 <- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=coaches, aes(x=reorder(Player, TotalZscore), weight=TotalZscore), fill=\"grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=Fredscore, aes(x=reorder(Player, TotalZscore), weight=TotalZscore), fill= \"#E41C38\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title=\"NCAA basketball coaches that played in the NBA: shooting and scoring ability\", subtitle= \"Fred Hoiberg was a below average scorer, but very efficient shooter.\", y=\"Scoring compared to rest of NBA\", x= \"\", caption = \"\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 9), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\nbar2 <- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=coachesshooting, aes(x=reorder(Player, ShootTotalzscore), weight=ShootTotalzscore), fill=\"grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=Fredshoot, aes(x=reorder(Player, ShootTotalzscore), weight=ShootTotalzscore), fill=\"#E41C38\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title=\"\", subtitle= \"\", x=\"\", y=\"Shooting compared to rest of NBA\", caption=\"Source: Basketball Reference| By Sam Hoiberg\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 9), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=11), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\nplot_grid(bar1, bar2)\n\n\n\n\n\nkhbjhvjhgjhvjh\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=PlayersPureShoot, aes(x=`3P%`, y=`FT%`), color=\"light grey\") +\n  geom_point(data=coachespureshoot, aes(x=`3P%`, y=`FT%`), color=\"dark grey\") + \n  geom_point(data=Fredpureshoot, aes(x=`3P%`, y=`FT%`), color=\"#E41C38\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=Fredpureshoot, aes(x=`3P%`, y=`FT%`, label= Player)) +\n  labs(title=\"NCAA basketball coaches that played in the NBA: Pure shooting ability\", subtitle=\"Fred was very consistent at the line as well as behind the arc near every season.
